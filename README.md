# <Who is Luis Ricardo Romero?>

## Description

I created this website to inform the visitors to give a brief overview of who I am. The reason for building this website was to show this to employers and to allow them to view previous projects that i have deployed. This also allows employers to also have some personal information on myself. This along with a resume will be everything that is needed to know who i am as a person as well as an employee. I learned how to use CSS properties on a whole different level. I also got a good understanding of what classes and ID's do for the HTML document.
